                        <h2>Dr. John Watson </h2>
                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>I am no genius—no master of deduction. That title belongs to Sherlock Holmes. Yet I walk beside him, bearing witness to his brilliance as he unravels the extraordinary from the mundane. There is no case too trivial for his mind, and I, John H. Watson—doctor, soldier, friend—find my purpose not in outshining him, but in chronicling the genius I am privileged to call my companion.</p>

                        <h2>Mycroft Holmes </h2>
                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>My brother may be the detective, chasing shadows through London’s fog. But I am the one who sees the entire game. While Sherlock dissects the crime, I shape the currents that move empires. He may solve puzzles—I move pieces on the board before others even know they’re in play. I do not seek the spotlight, but make no mistake: I understand how the world truly works.</p>

                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>The man is infuriating—arrogant, dismissive, always ten steps ahead. And yet, damn it, his methods work. Time and again, when we’re lost in the dark, Holmes strikes a match and lights the way. Scotland Yard may scoff and grumble, but deep down, we know the truth: we owe him more than we care to admit.</p>

                        <h2>Irene Adler </h2>
                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>He’s a remarkable man—brilliant, unyielding, and far too clever for his own good. But I often wonder if he’s capable of feeling, or if all that genius has left no room for a heart. As for me… I’ve lived in a world of men who underestimate, who assume charm is a weakness and beauty a distraction. But Holmes did not underestimate me. He saw through many masks—but not mine. And in the end, for all his intellect, he remembered me not as a puzzle… but as the woman.</p>

                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>Sherlock Holmes is the only man who has ever managed to outwit me. A rare intellect indeed—precise, relentless, almost beautiful in his obsession. We are two sides of the same coin, locked in a game that only one of us can win. The world sees him as a hero, me as a villain. But in truth, we are equals—each defined by the existence of the other.</p>

                        <h2> Mrs. Hudson </h2>
                        <div class="rating"></div>
                        <p>He rarely pays his rent on time, leaves chemicals in the sink, and the smell of gunpowder never quite fades… but I wouldn’t have anyone else living at 221B. For all his quirks, Mr. Holmes brings life to these old walls—and heaven help me, I’ve grown rather fond of the chaos.</p>
